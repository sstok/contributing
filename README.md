Contributing Guidelines
=======================

So you'd like to contribute to our project? Great!
We love contributors!

But we also care for good and readable code. So to help you
we have created a set of Contributing Guidelines (or guides)
to help explain our philosophy and principles.

In short these guides are for getting things done, programming well and in style.

*We'd like to thank the good people (and robots) at Thoughtbot for
sharing there Guides and allowing to adapt them for our needs.*
*See credits below for details.*

High level guidelines:

 * Be consistent.
 * Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide. 
 * Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
 * A reason is good when you can convince a team member.

A note on the language:

 * A "team member" is displayed as "Owner" or "Collaborator".  
 * "Avoid" means don't do it unless you have a good reason.
 * "Don't" means there's never a good reason.
 * "Prefer" indicates a better option and it's alternative to watch out for.
 * "Use" is a positive instruction.

Rendered guides
---------------

The guides are written in reStructuredText and can be
built into standard HTML using Sphinx. If you try to render them using
the GitHub repository browser some information will not be properly rendered.

You can view the rendered guides at [ReadTheDocs]

Credits

These guidelines were inspired largely by [Thoughtbot guides] and the
[Symfony Contributing guideline](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html).

If you would like to use these guides for your own project, please do so.
We tried to write them a neutral tone (not for one specific project or organization),
if you (or your team) have some additional requirements you can fork the content of 
this repository and apply your own requirements.

But remember to credit the original authors (as described in the license):
