Security Issues
===============

Because Rollerworks maintains a number of projects each project may follow
a more detailed protocol for handling security issues.

This document explains how Rollerworks security issues are handled (in general)
by the Rollerworks core team (Rollerworks being the code of any Rollerworks
project hosted on the Rollerworks `GitHub organization`_).

Reporting a Security Issue
--------------------------

If you think that you have found a security issue in any of the Rollerworks projects,
don't use the mailing-list or the bug tracker and don't publish it publicly. Instead, all
security issues must be sent to the private e-mail address of the project's maintainer.

The project's maintainer can be found in the copyright header of source files.

.. note::

    We are working a better way to report security issues, please recheck this
    before sending a message to the maintainer.

Resolving Process
-----------------

*This process is currently under discussion.*

.. note::

    Releases that include security issues should not be done on Saturday or
    Sunday, except if the vulnerability has been publicly posted.

.. note::

    While we are working on a patch, please do not reveal the issue publicly.

.. note::

    The resolution takes anywhere between a couple of days to a month depending
    on its complexity.
