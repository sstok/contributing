We love contributors! For more information on how you can contribute to the
Contributing Guidelines, please read [Contributing to the Documentation]
and notice the [Pull Request Format] that helps us merge your pull requests faster!

## Getting Feedback

Since these are our guides, we want everyone at our team to see them. We have
a lot of contributors across a lot of timezones, so we leave all PRs open for at
least a week to get feedback from everyone.
